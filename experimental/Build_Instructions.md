# Build instructions

These instructions are common for the models in Harry_Diamond_DFM, Loop_PEEP_3Way and Exhaust_PEEP.

## CNC

The device is constructed from 3/8" polycarbonate sheet stock, McMaster-Carr 8574K31 or equivalent.  It may be possible to use 1/4" inch sheet stock, McMaster-Carr 8574K172, however in that case the NPT fittings should be carefully screwed in to a depth of no more than 4mm so they don't block the channels. For prototyping, acrylic may be used instead of polycarbonate; it is more fragile, and does not resist alcohol-based cleaning agents.

Drill and tap the holes in the base.  The large output and vent holes are 3/4 NPT.  The input and side vent are 1/4 NPT.  The adjustment screws are 4-40, except for one larger screw which is 1/4-28.

Mill the channels into the top piece to the depth and width shown in the CAD file +- 0.05mm, using a CNC mill.  Channel cross section area is a critical dimension.  Do NOT mill the face which will become a joint between the pieces: it should have the original smooth surface from the plastic sheet.  Make sure the channel sides and bottom are smooth (surface finish ISO N6 or better).

Make sure that there are no burrs left, and the face which will be joined to the other piece is flat.

Clean and degrease the mating surfaces thoroughly.

Spread a thin, uniform layer of water-thin acrylic solvent cement: IPS Weld-On 3, SciGrip 3, McMaster-Carr 7528A13 or equivalent, on the entire cover piece, then press the base piece onto it with the channels pointed DOWN (so that the solvent doesn't drip into the channels).  Clamp with 200 lb force.  Let sit for 30 minutes while keeping the channels pointed down the whole time.  Do this step in a fume hood as the solvent cement is toxic if inhaled.  Full joint strength requires >24 hours.

Inspect the weld.  The weld should be essentially invisible; there may be a few bubbles, and a bit of squeeze-out at the edges of the channels, but there should be no large voids allowing leakage between channels, and no voids near the power nozzle/main jet.

Adjustment screws:  
- Stainless Steel Flat-Tip Set Screws, 4-40, 1/4" long, McMaster-Carr 94355A140
- Stainless Steel Flat-Tip Set Screws, 1/4-28, 1/4" long, McMaster-Carr 94355A602

Output fittings:    
- Plastic Barbed Tube Fitting, 3/4 NPT x 3/4 barb, nylon, McMaster-Carr 5372K133 or 53415K217	

These can be connected to 22mm tapered fittings common in respiratory care with short pieces of 3/4 silicone tubing, McMaster-Carr 5236K527.

Input and side vent: 
- Plastic Barbed Tube Fitting, 1/4 NPT x 1/4 barb, nylon, McMaster-Carr 5372K112 or 5121K451
(side vent may be optionally connected to 1/4 NPT x 3/4 barb, McMaster-Carr 5372K122)

Note: NPT fittings are typically seated to a depth of 4mm (finger tight) to 7mm (maximum, requires wrench).  Make sure they are not seated deep enough to block the channels; if using 1/4 sheet stock, the maximum depth is 4mm.

Note: these fittings are ONLY suitable for testing; medical connectors tend to use completely different types of connections.
