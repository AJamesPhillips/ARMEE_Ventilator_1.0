# ARMEE PEEP-Loop HPDC Estimates

by Yannick Charron-Tousignant

These are for an aluminum-cast device, which we note is unlikely to be our chosen material for hospitals (polycarbonate or similar USP Class-6 materials are a better bet), but still gives us a good cost/speed ballpark.  Yannick would like us to point out that these estimates are rough, may need a "trim die" to remove parting line flash and gating, and is based on 1 full year worth of production - the $/part will be affected considerably depending on production volumes, mostly because of tooling costs.

Roughly, the cost would be arround $2.75/set Â±1$ (lid+body) for a year's production (10M+ units). A more realistic number might be $50,000 for a die cast which can make 500,000 units (a single cast's lifetime) in about 110 days by a single machine.  Horizontal scaling would improve speed but increase total costs due to higher unit volumes paid upfront by the mold costs.
