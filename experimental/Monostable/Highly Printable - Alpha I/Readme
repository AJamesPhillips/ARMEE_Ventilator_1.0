READ THIS BEFORE ANYTHING, you will need it!

Before we start, let me say that THIS VENTILATOR IS NOT A MEDICAL EQUIPMENT, it is NOT INTENTED TO BE USED IN HUMAN PATIENTS.

This is a single piece ventilator (unibody). It is highly printable using either FDM or SLA 3D printers.

SLA.

For SLA it is as simple as printing in one single piece. Nothing much to add here, just get the STL from SLA directory and print it.
Of course you need to orient the print to avoid suction due to cups formation by the internal channels of the print. 
But you already know that, after all you have a SLA printer! :-) 

FDM.

1- Unibody version:

In order to print a single body ventilator using a FDM I developed a technique I call assisted bridging (or eZ-bridging or patching). 
It consists in pre-printing a flat support to be placed manually latter in the print to scaffold the next layer. 
Such a layer will become the ceiling of the print.

In order to place the printed support (or patch) you will need to stop the print, place the patch manually and then 
continue printing from where it stopped. This can be achieved modifying the Gcode either manually or by script 
in your slicing software. You would find the document "eZ-bridging.doc" usefull to get more details on this technique.

It is simpler than you think and once you get the hang of it, you will be able to bridge other pieces you always wanted to print, 
but you cannot because your printer did not like bridging. Now she will like bridging.

2.- Two parts version:

If for some reason you want to print the ventilator in two parts, you can find this two pieces in the directory "Two Parts". 
You can print both pieces and then glue them together. 

Final words: THIS VENTILATOR IS NOT A MEDICAL EQUIPMENT, it is NOT INTENTED TO BE USED IN HUMAN PATIENTS!
