# Build instructions

The device is constructed from 1/4" polycarbonate sheet stock, McMaster-Carr 8574K172 or equivalent.
(Note: some models use 3/8" or 1/2" inch sheet stock; acrylic may be used instead of polycarbonate)

Mill the channels into the top piece to the depth and width shown in the CAD file +- 0.05mm, using a CNC mill.  Channel cross section area is a critical dimension.  Do NOT mill the face which will become a joint between the pieces: it should have the original smooth surface from the plastic sheet.  Make sure the channel sides and bottom are smooth (surface finish ISO N6 or better).

Tap the adjustment screw holes using a M3x0.5 tap.  Make sure that there are no burrs left, and the face which will be joined to the other piece is flat.

Clean and degrease the mating surfaces thoroughly.

Spread a thin, uniform layer of water-thin acrylic solvent cement: IPS Weld-On 3, SciGrip 3, McMaster-Carr 7528A13 or equivalent, on the bottom piece, then press the top piece onto it.  Clamp and let sit for 30 minutes; full joint strength requires >24 hours.  Do this step in a fume hood as the solvent cement is toxic if inhaled.

Tap the input fitting hole using a M6x1 tap.  Clamp the piece to prevent the joint cracking during the tapping operation.
