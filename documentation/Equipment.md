# Equipment

## Compressed air

A source of pressurized air capable of 100 lpm (2 cfm) at 340 kPa (50 psi)

Suggested: small oil-free air compressor, eg Porter Cable C2002

## Medical gas flow analyzer or ventilator tester

Device intended for certifying performance of ventilators in hospitals; contains pressure, flow and gas composition sensors.

Suggested 1: Fluke VT Plus HF; Fluke VT650 or VT900; TSI Certifier 4080; IMT Citrex H3, H4, H5.
These are expensive, typically > $2000 used.

Suggested 2: Siargo FS6122 or certain Sensirion  / Honeywell sensors have the right specs, but are not easy to interface

## Pressure gauge

Pressure gauge capable of measuring 0-50 cmH2O with <1 cmH2O accuracy

Suggested 1: HT Instrument HT 805 Bluetooth Digital Manometer

Suggested 2: U tube manometer made out of 50-80 cm long piece of clear tubing with 1/4" or 1/8" inner diameter (eg aquarium PVC tubing)

Note: these pressures are far too low for most pressure gauges, other than the gauges used for HVAC service.

## Flow gauge

Flow gauge capable of measuring +-50 lpm air flow with <1 lpm accuracy.  (+-100lpm and <0.1 lpm accuracy is preferred) 

Suggested: medical flow meter (combination rotameter and needle valve) eg Timeter, Amvex, Ohmeda brand - this is not ideal, but don't really have a recommendation for a good digital sensor yet.

## Test lung

A lung simulator with known (and preferably adjustable) resistance and compliance, within the range of C20-C50 ml/cmH2O and R5-R20 cmH2O/(liter/second).
