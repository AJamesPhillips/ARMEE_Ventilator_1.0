## Harry_Diamond_Respirator

(step and f3d files)

A replica of the original 1960s vintage US Army device.

Modeler: Alex Izvorski

Dimensions were obtained from a physical museum piece found in an art gallery in Chicago which is one of the only known copies in existence (so far) of the original 1968 US ["Army Emergency Respirator"](./research/1968_Army_Emergency_Respirator.pdf) developed at Harry Diamond Labs.

If constructed carefully, this is expected perform identically to the original, cycling at a useful range of pressures/rates depending on input flow and calibration; and also including having a negative end pressure (which is not a desirable property).  

Note: we have had problems with reproducibility, probably because of small air leaks between the two halves of the device.  Dimensions and surface finish are also very important, probably +-0.02mm and ISO N6 finish or better.
